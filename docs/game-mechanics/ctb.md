CTB stands for Conditional Time Battle, it's the system the game uses to determine turn order in battle.

## Mechanics
Each character and monster has a Base CTB, the higher their Agility, the lower their base CTB. At the start of an encounter each character and monster is assigned a CTB Value (you can find a detailed explanation [here](../rng/damage-crit-escape-icv.md#icv)), then the game starts decreasing everyones CTB Value until someone has a CTB Value of 0, at which point that character/monster takes their turn and their CTB Value is set to `Base CTB * Action Rank`, continuing the process until the encounter is over.

If more than one character/monster has a CTB Value of 0, characters get priority over monsters; if there is still a tie (meaning multiple characters or monsters or both have 0 CTB) they get ordered based on their Agility Stat (who has higher Agility goes first) and lower indexes have priority over higher indexes: Tidus (character index 0) has priority over everyone else, Wakka (4) has priority over Lulu (5) and Rikku (6); the monster in slot 1 has priority over the other monsters, the monster in slot 3 has priority over monsters in slots 4 to 8.

Some actions have a CTB "damage" or "healing" component: Haste decreases CTB by `Current CTB // 2`, Slow doubles the current CTB (Chocobo Feather, Chocobo Wing, Silver Hourglass and Gold Hourglass work the same way); Delay Attack and other actions that have a Weak Delay increase CTB by `Base CTB * 3 // 2`, Delay Buster and other actions that have a Strong Delay increase CTB by `Base CTB * 3`.

If an action is performed under the Haste status the CTB Value is divided in half, rounding up; under the Slow status the CTB Value is doubled.

When a character is revived their CTB Value is set to `Base CTB * 3`, even if under the Haste or Slow status.

At the start of the turn of a character or a monster under the Sleep Status their CTB Value is set to `Base CTB * 3` and their turn immediately ends.

In some fights, most notably the one vs Sahagin Chiefs and the Seymour one in Macalania Temple, one of the monsters (the first Slot 4 Sahagin Chief and Anima respectively) is assigned a CTB Value normally but until they become active it is set to `Base CTB * 3` as soon as it reaches 1, making it not possible to ever act since their CTB Value is never 0 and with the side effect of making their turns last slightly shorter than normal (`(Base CTB * 3) - 1` ticks instead of the normal `Base CTB * 3`).

## CTB Table
Each possible value of the Agility Stat and its corresponding Base CTB and ICV Variance:

| Agility | Base CTB | ICV Variance | Character ICV Range | Monster ICV Range |
