## Strategy explanation
In the third Luca encounter you fight three waves of Workers, with two of them in each wave: usually in the 1st wave one is killed with 2 Tidus Attacks, 1 Kimahri Attack and Kimahri's Seed Cannon and the other is killed by Lulu's Thunder; in the 2nd wave both Workers are killed by Lulu; in the 3rd wave one of them is killed by Lulu and the other is killed with 2 Kimahri Attacks and 3 Tidus Attacks.

There is a small chance (9% for both Tidus and Kimahri) that one of the Attacks will crit: in that case it's possible to Attack instead of using Seed Cannon and use it later in the fight but there is still a small chance that 4 Attacks will not kill even if one of them is a crit.

## Lancet strategy
By using Lancet with Kimahri it's possible to skip 2 Worker Attacks since Lancet is a faster action than Attack, with the added benefit of making it impossible for Lulu to get a 2nd turn before the first wave is dead.

1st wave:
- Tidus > Attack > Worker A
- Kimahri > Lancet > Worker A
- Lulu > Thunder > Worker B
- if Tidus crit or has a Lightningstrike weapon:
    - Kimahri > Lancet > Worker A
- else:
    - Kimahri > Seed Cannon > Worker A

2nd wave:
- Lulu > Thunder > Worker B
- Tidus > Defend
- Kimahri > Defend (x2 if he didn't Seed Cannon)
- Lulu > Thunder > Worker A

3rd wave:
- Tidus > Attack > Worker A
- Kimahri > Lancet > Worker A (x2)
- Lulu > Thunder > Worker B
- Tidus > Attack > Worker A
