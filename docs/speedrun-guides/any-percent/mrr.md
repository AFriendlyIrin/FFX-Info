## Strategy explanation
In Mushroom Rock Road it's necessary to farm AP for Yuna and Kimahri: the strategy involves using Energy Ray on an encounter, doing a Sphere Grid to give Yuna (and Valefor) more Magic and Magic Defense, doing a second encounter to recharge Valefor's Overdrive then killing Raptors and Gandarewas until reaching a certain amount of AP on Yuna.

## First fight (using Energy Ray)
The formation should be Tidus/Wakka/Auron; since Funguars give more AP compared to other monsters (44 vs 32), it's preferable to kill an encounter containing one but to avoid having to farm encounters at the end of the road kill anything that isn't a Garuda after fleeing 2 encounters.

As long as Kimahri and Wakka took a turn in battle and they are alive, you can Switch anyone for Yuna and Summon Valefor to Energy Ray with her (both Energy Ray and Energy Blast will kill anything but the former has a shorter animation), even on an Ambush.

### Structure of the fight
*   Tidus > Switch > Kimahri
*   Kimahri > Defend
*   Wakka > Defend
*   Auron > Switch > Yuna
*   Yuna > Summon > Valefor
*   Valefor > Energy Ray > All enemies

## Second fight (recharging Valefor's OD)
The formation should be Tidus/Wakka/Auron; the strat consists of killing one of the monsters with Wakka and the other 2 with Valefor; one of the monsters will always be a Red Element and it will use 2 Fires on Valefor, one after she uses a spell and one after she Boosts; Valefor will then kill the Red Element with a Blizzard to end the fight and to finish charging her Overdrive.

Some things to keep in mind:
*   Wakka needs to have an Icestrike weapon equipped (usually the Scout you pick up in Kilika Woods) so that he can kill Raptors in one attack;
*   Flee from Garuda encounters;
*   never Summon Valefor if there are 3 monsters still alive unless one of them is a Raptor as they cannot hit her;
*   on a Preemptive Defend once with every party member or Shield once with Valefor right after she is Summoned (she should have 2 turns in a row before Shielding);
*   on an Ambush it's sometimes possible to continue the fight like normal but in general it's best to Flee/Escape.

### Structure of the fight
1st action (Tidus' turn):
*   if Lamashtu:
    *   Tidus > Switch > Kimahri
    *   Kimahri > Attack > Lamashtu
*   if Gandarewa and no Raptor:
    *   Tidus > Switch > Kimahri
    *   Kimahri > Lancet > Gandarewa
*   if there was no Funguar in the Energy Ray encounter (meaning Kimahri doesn't have 6 S. Lvls):
    *   Kimahri > Defend
*   else:
    *   Tidus > Defend

2nd action (Wakka's turn):
*   if Raptor:
    *   Wakka > Attack > Raptor
*   if Gandarewa:
    *   Wakka > Attack > Gandarewa (if it doesn't die Flee and start over)

3rd action (Auron's turn):
*   Auron > Switch > Yuna
*   Yuna > Summon > Valefor

There should be only 2 enemies alive and if a Lamashtu is present it should be already damaged (Valefor can't kill a Lamashtu at full HP with one spell).

4th action (if Valefor has 2 turns in a row Shield (to waste a turn), then use a spell):
*   if Funguar:
    *   Fire > Funguar
*   if Lamashtu:
    *   Fire > Lamashtu
*   If Gandarewa:
    *   Water > Gandarewa

Valefor should get hit by Fire from the Red Element, if she doesn't then Fire the Red Element.

5th action:
*   Valefor > Boost

Valefor should get hit by Fire from the Red Element, if she doesn't then Boost again.

6th action:
*   Valefor > Blizzard > Red Element

### Strategy for each possible formation
Read the section above to understand how the fight should look like but if you have trouble following it during runs you can check what the enemy formation is and follow the corresponding strat.

Red Element, Raptor, Lamashtu:
*   Tidus > Switch > Kimahri
*   Kimahri > Attack > Lamashtu
*   Wakka > Attack > Raptor
*   Auron > Switch > Yuna
*   Yuna > Summon > Valefor
*   Fire > Lamashtu (Valefor gets hit by Fire)
*   Boost (Valefor gets hit by Fire)
*   Blizzard > Red Element

Lamashtu, Gandarewa, Red Element:
*   Tidus > Switch > Kimahri
*   Kimahri > Attack > Lamashtu
*   Wakka > Attack > Gandarewa (if it doesn't die Flee)
*   Auron > Switch > Yuna
*   Yuna > Summon > Valefor
*   Fire > Lamashtu (Valefor gets hit by Fire)
*   Boost (Valefor gets hit by Fire)
*   Blizzard > Red Element

Funguar, Red Element, Gandarewa:
*   Tidus > Switch > Kimahri
*   Kimahri > Lancet > Gandarewa
*   Wakka > Attack > Gandarewa
*   Auron > Switch > Yuna
*   Yuna > Summon > Valefor
*   Fire > Funguar (Valefor gets hit by Fire)
*   Boost (Valefor gets hit by Fire)
*   Blizzard > Red Element

Raptor, Red Element, Gandarewa:
*   If Kimahri needs AP:
    *   Tidus > Switch > Kimahri
    *   Kimahri > Defend
*   Else:
    *   Tidus > Defend
*   Wakka > Attack > Raptor
*   Auron > Switch > Yuna
*   Yuna > Summon > Valefor
*   Water > Gandarewa (Valefor gets hit by Fire)
*   Boost (Valefor gets hit by Fire)
*   Blizzard > Red Element

Raptor, Funguar, Red Element:
*   If Kimahri needs AP:
    *   Tidus > Switch > Kimahri
    *   Kimahri > Defend
*   Else:
    *   Tidus > Defend
*   Wakka > Attack > Raptor
*   Auron > Switch > Yuna
*   Yuna > Summon > Valefor
*   Fire > Funguar (Valefor gets hit by Fire)
*   Boost (Valefor gets hit by Fire)
*   Blizzard > Red Element

## Third fight onward
The formation should be Yuna/Wakka/Kimahri, in these fights the only goal is to kill one monster with Wakka (a Raptor or a Gandarewa) to give AP to Yuna, keep repeating the same strat until she reaches 3 S.Lv.

### Structure of the fight
*   If the formation doesn't contains a Raptor or a Gandarewa:
    *   Yuna > Switch > Tidus
    *   Tidus > Flee > All
*   Else:
    *   Yuna > Defend
    *   Wakka > Attack > Raptor/Gandarewa (prioritize Raptors since they always die and have a 2/32 chance to get Overkilled)
    *   Kimahri > Switch > Tidus
    * Tidus > Flee > All
