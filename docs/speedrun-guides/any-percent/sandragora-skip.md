## Strategy explanation
Sandragora skip makes it possible to use Kimahri's Overdrive (normally used to kill one of the Sandragoras in Bikanel) in a fight between him learning Stone Breath and the 2nd Home fight. 

In the case of a Blitz Loss run, the best fight to use Kimahri's Overdrive is the 2nd Home fight, so that he can Lancet a Dual Horn and use Stone Breath again in the fight inside the Friend Sphere room.

In a Blitz Win run, the best fight to use Kimahri's Overdrives is the Seymour fight in Macalania Temple: killing the 2 Guado Guardians with Stone Breath before they take a turn removes the possibility of getting confused by Shremedy or for Yuna to die by getting targeted by all 3 enemies and it allows to save Tidus' Overdrive for a later fight (either Wendigo or Evrae).

## Seymour strategy (Stone Breath, by [{{ site.contributors.loftus.name }}]({{ site.contributors.loftus.url }}))
For this strategy to work it's necessary to equip Brotherhood before the fight: the enemies' ICVs are based on your fastest character, if Tidus had the Sonic Steel they would be 0, meaning that Kimahri would never get a turn before the Guado Guardians since he is slower than them.

*   Tidus > Haste > Tidus
*   Yuna > Swap Weapon > Staff
*   Kimahri > Stone Breath
*   Yuna > Switch > Auron
*   Auron > Defend
*   Tidus > Talk > Seymour
*   Tidus > Defend
*   Auron > Defend
*   Tidus > Attack > Seymour

Only the 1st phase of the fight changes, the rest works like normal.

## Wendigo strategy (Spiral Cut)
In this case the strategy is almost identical to the normal one, the only difference is that the first Attack on Wendigo should instead be a Spiral Cut (the target will be reset to Guado Guardian A after using Spiral Cut so it's necessary to switch target to Wendigo again).

## Wendigo strategy (Spiral Cut and Petrify Grenade)
The formation should be Tidus/Rikku/Kimahri.

*   Tidus > Haste > Tidus
*   Tidus > Weapon > Brotherhood
*   Tidus > Switch > Auron
*   Auron > Power Break > Wendigo
*   Rikku > Petrify Grenade

Wendigo has a 2/3 chance to attack randomly for around 900 damage and a 1/3 chance to attack the lowest HP party member for around 1500 damage: 56% for Rikku to get targeted (she always dies), 44% chance for either Auron or Kimahri to get targeted (they both always survive).

*   Kimahri > Switch > Tidus
*   Tidus > Attack > Wendigo (x2)
*   if Rikku survived:
    *   Rikku > Defend (you can have her Attack herself if she needs Overdrive)

Wendigo will attack again: no matter what happened in it's previous turn, there will always be at least 1 character other than Tidus and they will have less HP than him, meaning that Tidus will never die.

*   Tidus > Attack > Wendigo (x2 or x3)
*   if someone else is alive:
    *   other character > Switch > Yuna
    *   Yuna > Defend

At this point Wendigo will always be below 9000 HP, meaning that on it's next turn it will raise its hands and for the next 3 turns it will do nothing and it will counter Attacks and Skills, but not Overdrives, meaning that even if Tidus has been attacked he will always be able to kill Wendigo.

If Tidus crit at least once or attacked a 5th time (5% chance, depends on Wendigo's and Kimahri's ICV), Spiral Cut will always kill and there is a really high chance that 2 Attacks will kill (keep in mind that Tidus' minimum damage is 2509 and Wendigo can do up to 1250 with it's counterattack).

*   if Tidus is the only one alive:
    *   Tidus > Switch > Yuna
    *   Yuna > Defend
    *   Yuna > Switch > Lulu
    *   Lulu > Defend
    *   Lulu > Switch > Tidus
*   else:
    *   Yuna > Switch > Lulu
    *   Lulu > Defend
*   Tidus > Spiral Cut > Wendigo (depending on damage rolls Wendigo may die here)
*   Tidus > Attack > Wendigo

## Evrae strategy (Spiral Cut and Tallboy Mix)
This strategy requires a Lv. 4 Key Sphere (one can be picked up right after the forced Chimeras and Guado encounter, on the right after the stairs) and a Yellow Sphere (Seymour always drops either Blk Magic or Special Spheres, both work) for a Mix; the formation should be Tidus/Rikku/Kimahri.

This strategy only works 90% of the times if not using any Damaging Item, 99% of the times if using a Lightning Marble/Bomb Core/Arctic Wind, 99.7% of the times if using a Silence Grenade/Smoke Bome/Sleeping Powder (these chances are calculated assuming at least 2.5s remaining when using Spiral Cut).

*   Tidus > Haste > Tidus
*   Tidus > Cheer (x2)
*   Rikku > Mix > Lv. 4 Key Sphere + Yellow Sphere (Tallboy)
*   Tidus > Attack > Evrae
*   Rikku/Kimahri > Steal or Use Damaging Item > Evrae
*   repeat this x3:
    *   if last Attack crit:
        *   Tidus > Cheer
    *   else:
        *   Tidus > Attack > Evrae
*   as soon as Evrae uses Haste:
    *   Tidus > Spiral Cut > Evrae
