## Cereth Warp
Using a Return Sphere on a node 1 S. Lv away from a character, with the goal of saving 1 S. Lv on that character.

## Clasko Skip
This is a skip performed at the start of Mushroom Rock Road, skipping a cutscene involving Clasko. This skip typically precedes the much larger [MRR Skip](#mrr-skip).

## CSR
Cutscene Remover. It is a tool developed by the FFX speedrun community with the goal of removing cutscenes from the game. CSR can also be used to describe the speedrun category that uses the aforementioned tool.

## Djose Skip
This is an infamous skip for its difficulty, and considered [TAS](#tas) only. Performing this skips Djose Temple and avoids obtaining Ixion.

## FS
First Strike. An Auto-ability on weapons that guarantees that the character will act first in battles (it sets their ICV to 0, see [here](../rng/damage-crit-escape-icv.md#icv) for a more detailed explanation).

## FMV Skip
FMVs (Full-Motion Videos) are pre-rendered cutscenes in the game - the highest detail cutscenes in which the player has no control. In the HD release of the game, it's possible to skip some, but not all of these cutscenes.

## FMV Skip Glitch
Also known as FMV Storage Skip. By exploiting a bug, it's possible to skip some FMVs that are not ordinarily possible to skip.

## LS
Lightning Steel, the most common Lightningstrike weapon used in speedruns, useful for the [Sahagin Chiefs](./any-percent/sahagin-chiefs.md) and Extractor Encounters.

## Manip
Short for RNG Manipulation. The process of taking specific actions to forge a favorable and predictable outcome.

## MRR Skip
Mushroom Rock Road skip. See [Terra Skip](#terra-skip).

## NEA/NE Armor
No Encounter Armor. No Encounters is an ability on armor pieces that prevents all random battles from occurring as long as the armor is equipped.

The armor is notable for being a very rare drop, and is typically obtained through [RNG Manipulation](../rng/index.md) in order to save time.

## Party Formations
Party formations can be indicated by the initials of each character. For example, "TKR" would mean Tidus, Kimahri, Rikku formation. Any combination of T/Y/A/L/W/K/R can be used to notate a specific formation.

This should not be confused with YKT or YAT, which are machina enemies in the game.

## RNG Fix
RNG Fix is a tool that accompanies the [CSR tool](#csr). The RNG Fix addition modifies how RNG works in FFX in such a way that it can no longer be manipulated.

## S-Claw/P-Claw strats
S-Claw and P-Claw are Weapons for Rikku with the Auto-abilities Distill Speed and Distill Power respectively, they can be used to [convert Item Drops to Spheres](./any-percent/spheres.md#distillers).

## SD
*   Skip Dialogue. A notation used in guides to signify that the cutscene contains dialogue that can be skipped.
*   Self-Destruct. One of Kimahri's overdrives - this ability deals 3 times Kimahri's maximum HP.

## Seed
A seed is a starting point for random number generation. After determining a starting seed, it's possible to predict the outcome of events by performing pre-determined actions.

## TAS
Tool-Assisted Speedrun. This is a type of speedrun that utilises input recording and frame advancing tools to achieve the fastest possible speedrun, far beyond human capabilities.

## Terra Skip
This skip circumvents the majority of Mushroom Rock Road, including the Sinspawn Gui fights and several cutscenes.

## Tetris
Refers to the Zanarkand trials, in which some of the puzzle elements resemble Tetris pieces.

## Tier 1/2/3 Items
Damage items often come in 3 power varities, similar to magic (e.g. Fire, Fira, Firaga).
*   Ice: Antarctic Wind, Arctic Wind, Ice Gem.
*   Fire: Bomb Fragment, Bomb Core, Fire Gem.
*   Lightning: Electro Marble, Lightning Marble, Lightning Gem.
*   Water: Fish Scale, Dragon Scale, Water Gem.
  
These grenades are also often referred to as "Tier 2":
*   Sleeping Powder, Smoke Bomb, Silence Grenade.

## UCG
Ultimate Companion Guide. A highly detailed bestiary written by Pbirdman, containing information on every enemy in the game.
